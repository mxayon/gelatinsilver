##  About Gelatin Silver
[#about]
The **_Gelatin Silver Process_** is one of the earliest forms of developing images on light-sensitive paper.<br>
Before a paper is exposed, the image layer is a clear gelatin matrix holding the light-sensitive silver halides. - <br>

> .. gelatin silver printing is an example of "latent" printing, in which an image is activated by light, but is not revealed until submerged in a developer solution. In this case, a negative image is projected onto paper treated with light-sensitive chemicals: silver halide suspended in gelatin (a viscous liquid made from animal collagen). A series of chemical baths will subsequently reveal the latent image, halt the development, remove its sensitivity to light, and fine-tune contrast.
